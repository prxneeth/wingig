                Employers determine full-time status based on business needs and
                typically consider an employee to be full-time if they work
                anywhere from 32 to 40 or more hours per week. However, certain
                laws define full-time differently, which considers full-time as
                working, on average, at least 30 hours per week.

                Employee who works less than full-time. While this sounds
                obvious, it's important to spell out this distinction in your
                employee policy manual. You can designate specific types of
                employees or specific types of jobs as part-time.

                Freelancers are all types of Independent Contractors that are
                part of the contingent workforce. Unlike temporary employees
                (temps), ICs are not employed by a company or staffing firm.
                Freelancers are skilled independent professionals, who only work
                on a project basis.
